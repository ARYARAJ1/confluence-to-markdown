Pipeline runs in ADF for ingestion feeds will have logs stored in Cosmos
DB.

| `isIngestion`        | Default value set to `true` as the logging pipeline is only used for ingestion feeds. As both ingestion and data warehouse logs are stored in the same container, this key allows us to determine that it is an ingestion feed log. |
| `forcedSuccess`      | If set to `true` , a forced success has occurred with the value being passed down from an activity in the pipeline run.                                                                                                             |

| `timestamp`          | Time of the run in UTC                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `hyperPipelineRunId` | ID of the hyper pipeline run (parent pipeline)                                                                                                                                                                                      |

PARKED NOTES:

-   \[Parent page\]: Anything to do with logging can be found in Cosmos
    Observability DB

-   DWH deployment needed for datasets + linked services

-   Updates needed foy any ingestion tests that points to ADF
