| Outcome      | VMIA agreed that Option 1 is the best option moving forward which sees reporting being produced out of the strategic data platform. The implication of going with Option 1 is that for some reports the full data set may not be available during co-existence. In those instances Option 2 will be considered for some reports depending on complexity and importance which will be decided on a case by case basis. |

## Background

As data (such as client list) is migrated and mastered from legacy
systems (Risk Console/Client Connect) into PEGA, there is a requirement
to ensure that any business reports dependent on this data are still
accurate and representative of the performance of the whole business.
This decision explores potential design options to mitigate the impact
on downstream reports as data is being migrated.

### Current state dataflows

As a point of reference the existing dataflows identified in the
analysis undertaken are represented in the diagram below.

An extensive analysis and assessment (9 meetings over a week) was
undertaken to identify all existing reports that will be impacted during
co-existence, broken down by release based on the functionality that
PEGA will drop in each release.  

The following table summarises the findings:

## Relevant data

The information below provides details of the design on the proposed
options.

**Option 1: Reporting out of the Data Warehouse on the Strategic Data
Platform**

This option would involve accelerating the development of the Data
Warehouse portion of the strategic Data Platform. The data marts and
star schemas will be reused or remodeled and enhanced based on the VMIA
business processes. Existing reports that are currently sourced from
IDR2, SAS, Cognos or directly from Risk Console or Client Connect will
be rebuild using the new Data Platform.

For the co-existence, logic will be incorporated in the integration
layer to combine data from legacy and PEGA BIX. Gradually data will be
sourced more and more from the PEGA BIX channel until the data migration
project is completed. The migration metadata will be used to know which
data in reports should be sourced from PEGA BIX and which from the
legacy sources . The above solution would have the following steps:

-   Create / adapt star schemas to existing / improved business
    processes due to use of the new PEGA application

-   Create strategic acquisition pipelines to load data into the
    platform

-   Create strategic ETL pipelines with logic that combines the legacy
    and PEGA data for load into the new data warehouse structures

-   Creation of reports out of the new Data platform

The dotted lines on the diagram below describe the data flows during
co-existence.

data-media-id="3ab153f2-af4f-4e8b-8699-065654619b84"
data-media-type="file" width="544" />

**Option 2: Report from Data lake but rebuild reports to not use SAS**

This option would involve rebuilding the SAS reports outside SAS using
data directly from the Data Lake. Data flows will be developed to
combine the relevant data from RC and PEGA and recreate the reports in
the required format.

Data extracts will still be sent to SAS only for use of the actuary
team. Reports will be created containing consolidated PEGA and legacy
data.

This process would required the following data flows to be developed:

-   Acquisition and Ingestion of Risk Console and Client Connect data
    into the raw layer of the data platform

-   Acquisition and Ingestion of PEGA BIX data into the Data Lake of the
    data platform

-   Creation of data flows to combine and prepare data for the extracts

The dotted lines on the diagram below describe the data flows during
co-existence.

data-media-id="0d56de91-226c-4775-9256-c992fed1e85c"
data-media-type="file" width="544" />

**Option 3: Use interim common table structures to combine legacy and
PEGA data**

As per option 1, this would require legacy and PEGA data to be ingested
into the Data Platform. A number of common data structures would be
created that including all necessary fields for the existing reports
from legacy. Data from PEGA for the migrated clients will be merged into
these structures. Once the data is combined, extracts could be created
that feed into IDR2 and SAS similar to the old extract feeds. SAS and
IDR2 can be re-pointed to use the new extracts instead of the current
sources and all reporting out of these systems will stay intact. The
migration metadata will be used to know which data in reports should be
sourced from PEGA BIX and which from the legacy sources. This option
will require the following data flows:

-   Strategic acquisition and Ingestion of Risk Console and Client
    Connect data into the raw layer of the data platform as required by
    the old data extracts

-   Acquisition and Ingestion of PEGA BIX data into the data platform

-   ETL processes to combine the data and load into the common data
    structures

-   Creation of extracts to simulate the previous legacy extracts

-   Re-pointing of new extracts to IDR2 and SAS to be used as a source
    now

Once the data flows above have been developed and a common data
structure has been populated, this will then act as the new data source
for downstream reports allowing VMIA to maintain visibility of their
clients across both systems.

The dotted lines on the diagram below describe the data flows during
co-existence.

data-media-id="88cb93c3-2fe5-4096-805e-a29a2e3116d0"
data-media-type="file" width="544" />

**Option 4: Report on Data Lake and IDR2 and no SAS**

This option would involve rebuilding the SAS reports outside SAS using
data ingested into IDR2. New data flows would be developed sending the
PEGA BIX data from the data platform to IDR2. New SSIS load packages
would be developed to combine the relevant data from RC and PEGA and
populate the star schemas appropriately. Any additional fields needed to
enable the functionality of the reports would be added to the IDR2
solution. Reports will be then recreated out of IDR2 in the required
format.

Data extracts will still be sent to SAS only for use of the actuary
team. Reports will be created containing consolidated PEGA and legacy
data.

This process would required the following data flows to be developed:

-   Acquisition and Ingestion of Risk Console and Client Connect data
    into the raw layer of the data platform

-   Acquisition and Ingestion of PEGA BIX data into the Data Lake of the
    data platform

-   Development of SSIS packages to load new data into IDR2 staging

-   Creation of SSIS packages to combine and load data into the star
    schemas

-   Creation of new reports out of IDR2

co-existence.

<th class="confluenceTh"><p>Description</p></th>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>This option would involve accelerating the
development of the Data Warehouse portion of the strategic Data
Platform. The Data marts and star schemas will be reused or remodeled
and enhanced based on the VMIA business processes. Existing reports that
are currently sourced from IDR2, SAS, Cognos or directly from Risk
Console or Client Connect will be rebuild using the new Data
Platform.</p>
<p>For the co-existence, logic will be incorporated in the integration
layer to combine data from legacy and PEGA BIX. Gradually data will be
sourced more and more from the PEGA BIX channel until the data migration
project is completed. The migration metadata will be used to know which
data in reports should be sourced from PEGA BIX and which from the
legacy sources. The above solution would have the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create / adapt star schemas to existing / improved business
processes due to use of the new PEGA application</p></li>
<li><p>Fast track strategic data acquisition patterns</p></li>
<li><p>Create ETL pipelines with logic that combines the legacy and PEGA
data for load into the new data warehouse structures</p></li>
<li><p>Creation of reports out of the new Data platform</p></li>
</ul></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>This option would involve rebuilding the SAS
reports outside SAS using data directly from the Data Lake. Data flows
will be developed to combine the relevant data from RC and PEGA and
recreate the reports in the required format.</p>
<p>Data extracts will still be sent to SAS only for use of the actuary
team. Reports will be created containing consolidated PEGA and legacy
data.</p>
<p>This process would required the following data flows to be
developed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Acquisition and Ingestion of Risk Console and Client Connect data
into the raw layer of the data platform</p></li>
<li><p>Acquisition and Ingestion of PEGA BIX data into the Data Lake of
the data platform</p></li>
<li><p>Creation of data flows to combine and prepare data for the
extracts</p></li>
</ul></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>This option would require legacy and PEGA
data to be ingested into the Data Platform separately. A common data
structure would be created that includes all necessary fields for
reporting from legacy. Data from PEGA for the migrated clients would be
merged into these structures. Once the data is combined, extracts could
be created that feed into IDR2 and SAS similar to the old extract feeds.
SAS and IDR2 can be re-pointed to use the new extracts instead and all
reporting out of these systems will stay intact. This option will
require the following data flows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Acquisition and Ingestion of Risk Console and Client Connect data
into the raw layer of the data platform as required by the old data
extracts</p></li>
<li><p>Acquisition and Ingestion of PEGA BIX data into the data
platform</p></li>
<li><p>ETL processes to combine the data and load into the common data
structures</p></li>
<li><p>Creation of extracts to simulate the previous legacy
extracts</p></li>
<li><p>Re-pointing of new extracts to IDR2 and SAS to be used as a
source now</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the data flows above have been developed and a common data
structure has been populated this will then act as the new data source
for downstream reports allowing VMIA to maintain visibility of their
clients across both systems.</p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>This option would involve rebuilding the SAS
reports outside SAS using data ingested into IDR2. New data flows would
be developed sending the PEGA BIX data from the data platform to IDR2.
New SSIS load packages would be developed to combine the relevant data
from RC and PEGA and populate the star schemas appropriately. Any
additional fields needed to enable the functionality of the reports
would be added to the IDR2 solution. Reports will be then recreated out
of IDR2 in the required format.</p>
<p>Data extracts will still be sent to SAS only for use of the actuary
team. Reports will be created containing consolidated PEGA and legacy
data.</p>
<p>This process would required the following data flows to be
developed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Acquisition and Ingestion of Risk Console and Client Connect data
into the raw layer of the data platform</p></li>
<li><p>Acquisition and Ingestion of PEGA BIX data into the Data Lake of
the data platform</p></li>
<li><p>Development of SSIS packages to load new data into IDR2
staging</p></li>
<li><p>Creation of SSIS packages to combine and load data into the star
schemas</p></li>
<li><p>Creation of new reports out of IDR2</p></li>
