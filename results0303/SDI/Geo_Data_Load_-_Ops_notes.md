# Geo Data Load - Ops notes

The files are to be kept in folder
C:\\Users\\rahulp\\Python\\geo_files_pre_processing\\in_Files and the
output will be generated in the folder
C:\\Users\\rahulp\\Python\\geo_files_pre_processing\\out_Files

There are some files which are bigger than 500 MB, those files should be
processed separately in the interest of the time taken for processing.
All files \< 500 Mb can be processed together. Use the folder
C:\\Users\\rahulp\\Python\\geo_files_pre_processing\\in_Files_bkp for
keeping the files not being processed.

Once the files are processed, they should be copied over to the K:/
drive for further ingestion processing.
